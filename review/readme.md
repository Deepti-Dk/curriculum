# Giving feedback
We know what you are thinking: Why and how should i give feedback, when i don’t even know how to write good code yet!?

## Why should you give feedback?
There are quite a lot of reasons for giving feedback to other students. Here are a few:
- Giving feedback makes you reflect about the code you yourself wrote. 
- Giving feedback encourages understanding of the concepts used in a piece of code. 
- A bit obvious but giving feedback exercises your feedback giving skills. This can be super relevant for a new employer.
- Giving feedback shares knowledge between students. That can fx be good tips and best practices.

## How should you give feedback?
Imagine yourself as a detective arriving at a crime scene. A detective have to get an overview of what happened, he has to look for clues and ask lots of questions. It is the same being a code reviewer! 

First get an overview of the code. How is the structure, what are the files called, are there any frameworks being used. With an overview we can start investigating the code. Find a point of entry, where the code "starts". In html this is typically index.html. In css is typically main.css. In js it’s typically main.js with a specific function being called that starts the program.
Knowing where to begin our code review, start trying to understand the code.
Go through the code line by line and see if you can understand the purpose/intention of the code. If there is something you think could be improved or something that is well done, simply write that comment to the person in a slack message. It can be helpful to mention the line of code when giving feedback. 

We have written some [code review examples](review-examples.md) and made a  [review checklist](review-checklist.md). Try read them both and use the checklist when reviewing some code. 

## General thoughts on feedback
- Remember to include positive comments in your review. 
- Asking question can be code review aswell!
