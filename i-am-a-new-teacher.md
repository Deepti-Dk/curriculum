### Super nice that you joined our HYF Copenhagen teaching team, here are some practical things to help you get started:

\*:üë®‚Äçüíª: If you don't have access to one of the things mentioned below, ask Christopher.

## Slack
- Our Slack workplace has channels for every class, the main goal here is that we support students with questions/their homework during the week. You don't have to join all of them, but please join the channel of the class that you are currently teaching or helping out with. If you are not in Slack yet: :üë®‚Äçüíª: 
- We also have a mentor room (super secret). Not invited in yet? :arrow_right: :üë®‚Äçüíª: 

## So how is the curriculum structured again? 

We teach the curriculum split into 7 `modules`. A module usually consists of 3-5 `weeks`, depending on the subject.<br>
Displayed red below are the 4 "fundamental" modules - the first 12 weeks of the program. These are the hardest part for most students and require a lot of special attention.

At the end of the 7 modules we start a `final project` which is the most important product our students will take away from our classes. The goal is to let students build a real-world app using the skills they acquired during the course. An example can be seen [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/class02-final-project).

## Modules
- All modules have their own repository in our Github organization.
- We also have a nice and shiny overview of our [curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum). Here you can find information about when/how and what we teach.
- We divided everyone in our organization into teams, we have a teachers team, a team for every class etc. which all have different permissions.
- We have a private repository where fellow teachers share their [teaching-tips-and-tricks](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/teaching_tips_tricks), if you are new to teaching or are just curious on what they think works well in class, take a look.
- If you are teaching a certain module and would like to make changes on the contents of the repo, please create a branch with your name and your fellow teacher, like: `yourname_othername`. Our master branches are protected, if you would like to change something to the default module please make a PR.

## FAQ

- Q: **How much time does teaching require per week?**  
A: About 10 hours (preparing, teaching, feedback)

- Q: **Do I need to be a working professional to teach?**  
A: No, you don't need to be a working professional, but it is a big plus. We want our students to learn from people who work with the frameworks we teach on a daily basis and know the challenges of the market.  

- Q: **Will I be teaching all by myself?**  
A: No, teaching always happens in pairs. This allows for less pressure on the individual, split responsibility and a broader perspective for our students.

- Q: **Do I have to teach exactly like it says in the repo?**  
A: No, you can basically teach however you best see fit. We have learning goals we want to complete in each module and that the next module builds on, but that's about all that is set. You also don't need to reinvent the wheel about how to teach, all the material is there if you prefer to follow existing instructions.

- Q: **When do the classes take place?**  
A: Sundays 12:00 - 16:00
