# I'm a (new) teacher!

### Super nice that you joined our HYF Copenhagen teaching team, here are some practical things to help you get started:

\*:üë®‚Äçüíª: If you don't have access to any of the things mentioned below, ask Christopher or Benjamin.

## First things first

### Most crucial learning goals

We want our students to be able to work in a tech company in Denmark. Technical skills are important, but just as much is an understanding of what the job of a web-developer looks like. Collaboration, teamwork, an inquisitive mindset and **asking tons of questions** are crucial "soft" learnings that we want to encourage *over and over*. Relating what you teach in class to your daily tasks at work is also *always* super useful.

### Slack
Our Slack workplace is the main communication tool we use. It has channels for every class, the main goal here is that we support students with questions/their homework during the week. You don't have to join all channels, but please join the one of the class that you are currently teaching or helping out with. If you are not invited to Slack yet: :arrow_right: :üë®‚Äçüíª: 

### FAQ

- Q: **How much time does teaching require per week?**  
A: About 10 hours (preparing, teaching, feedback)

- Q: **Do I need to be a working professional to teach?**  
A: No, you don't need to be a working professional, but it is a big plus. We want our students to learn from people who work with the frameworks we teach on a daily basis and know the challenges of the market.  

- Q: **Will I be teaching all by myself?**  
A: No, teaching always happens in pairs. This allows for less pressure on the individual, split responsibility and a broader perspective for our students.

- Q: **Do I have to teach exactly like it says in the repo?**  
A: No, you can basically teach however you best see fit. We have learning goals we want to complete in each module and that the next module builds on. You also don't need to reinvent the wheel about how to teach, all the material (code examples, exercises and documentation) is there if you prefer to follow existing instructions.

- Q: **When do the classes take place?**  
A: Sundays 12:00 - 16:00    


### Types of volunteer roles

**What‚Äôs the difference between a mentor and a teacher at HYF?**   
A `mentor` is anyone who volunteers to help in our initiative and is part of our Slack community. This can entail answering questions on Slack, helping with events, helping with homework feedback or other flexible tasks.

A `teacher` is any mentor who is taking charge of an individual module and teaching the actual contents of the curriculum. Being a teacher comes with a certain amount of responsibility and time commitment. We would never ask something of you that you don‚Äôt want to do, but be aware that we trust you to be present and prepared for the sessions pertaining to the module you teach. Every module is taught by two teachers, so you are not solely responsible, but we expect that you communicate well with your teaching partner how to split up the tasks related to teaching.

**Homework support**  *(+/- 3 hours. Flexible)*  
Every week students have to hand in homework assignments. These assignments are key to measure their progress and to put into practice what they have learned. To have an extra check on how the students are doing there are three tests inside the curriculum. (after Javascript 2, Javascript 3 and React).

As a homework assistant you will check and provide feedback on the homework of the students and optionally revise their tests. Feedback should be provided within a week after homework has been submitted. Giving feedback in time is crucial as the next assignment builds on the knowledge gained throughout the previous homework assignment. This is a good example of detailed and helpful feedback. 

**1:1 Mentor** *(Ongoing, 1-2 hours per week. Flexible and depending on your mentee)*  
Some students need additional support throughout the course as the speed of our program is a challenge for them. That‚Äôs exactly what you will give them as a 1:1 mentor. You will help students by:

1) Assessing which concepts they are struggling with
2) Recapping these concepts by explaining and using examples of code
3) Supporting them with their homework (as opposed to making it for them) 
4) Being a friend and social support. The first person they can turn to. :)

It is important to make a clear agreement beforehand about the extent to which you will provide support and when. You can meet the student you are mentoring on the Sunday but due to the information overload of the class, most of the support will have to occur throughout the week. We ask you to organize at least one, but preferably two meetings or video calls a week of at least an hour.

**Teaching Assistant (TA)** *(4 hours Sunday + 1 hour preparation + ~2 hours homework support)*  
As a TA you provide support to the leading teacher. He/she might ask you to prepare presentation material to explain some of the concepts covered in class or an exercise to practice the theory. In some cases you are also asked to teach a small part of the class. In addition, you will help the students when they are working on an exercise and get stuck. You can provide them with an additional explanation, and steer them in the right direction. In this way we reduce the risk of students falling behind during class. Optionally, you can also help out with checking the homework.


**Teacher** *(4 hours Sunday, ~3 hours preparation + ~3 hours homework support)*  
During the week you will help providing feedback on the homework in GitHub and prepare your lecture. You have the freedom to structure your own lecture though the topics and guidelines for every week are provided by us in line with the curriculum. In practice this will mean that you have to study the concepts taught in the module and make a lesson plan containing both theory and practice. For reference, you can look at previous classes on our YouTube channel. Finally, if possible you will also help out with checking the homework.

To get used to our way of operating, you will start as a TA or homework support (or both). In principle we require you to participate in at least one module before you can start teaching or become a coding mentor. To gain experience you will be paired up with a more experienced teacher. 


Together we can take a look at our teaching schedule. We check when the modules in which you want to contribute take place, and make a plan for the next steps. 

**Workshops / Masterclasses**
From time to time we organize workshops or alumni masterclasses in which we go into detail with a specific topic. We have organized masterclasses on .NET development, Web Bluetooth/Web USB, Web Content Management & CMS Systems, Docker and many more. If you have a suggestion for a topic, please let us know!

### So how is the curriculum structured again? 

We teach the curriculum split into 7 `modules`. A module usually consists of 3-5 `weeks`, depending on the subject.<br>
Displayed red below are the 4 "fundamental" modules - the first 12 weeks of the program. These are the hardest part for most students and require a lot of special attention.
![Curriculum graphic + project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/blob/master/curriculum_graphic_new.png)
At the end of the 7 modules we start a `final project` which is the most important product our students will take away from our classes. The goal is to let students build a real-world app using the skills they acquired during the course. An example from `class07` can be seen [here](https://thefabricofmylife.herokuapp.com/).

### Modules
- All modules have their own repository in our Github organization.
- We also have a nice and shiny overview of our [curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum). Here you can find information about when/how and what we teach.
- We divided everyone in our organization into teams, we have a teachers team, a team for every class etc. which all have different permissions.
- We have a private repository where fellow teachers share their [teaching-tips-and-tricks](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/teaching_tips_tricks), if you are new to teaching or are just curious on what they think works well in class, take a look.
- If you are teaching a certain module and would like to make changes on the contents of the repo, please create a branch with your name and your fellow teacher, like: `yourname_othername`. Our master branches are protected, if you would like to change something to the default module please make a PR.
